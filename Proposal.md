### _Project Purpose and Goal:_

As someone who makes a ton of playlists on Spotify and love to share them as much as possible. I also love to discover new playlists well curated playlists, and searching through playlists can be difficult.  The goal of this site is to make that process easier. In its simplest form, this site would present a collection of Spotify playlists in a sleek fashion, and the user would be able to sign in to the site via their Spotify login. Access to this login information would allow the user to play the Spotify playlists through the site. 

### _List of minimum features:_ 
	* Display curated Spotify playlists in an organized fashion

	* Display a list of Spotify playlists by theme or curator, almost like a weekly radio show or mixtape.

	* Have a user sign in through personal Spotify account so playlists can be played through the site.  

### _What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules or resources will you use?_

	* React for building the front end of the site. 

	* Firebase for storing data

	* Spotify API for displaying playlists and for accessing user information. 

	* React Router library for creating separate pages. 

### _Stretch Goals:_ 

	* User can search playlists by name, artists, tags. 

	* User can add playlists to the library, as well as add tags to the added playlist. 

	* Experiment with the Spotify Web Playback SDK so tracks are played in the application 	and not in an imported Spotify player. 

	* use Spotify Connect Web API so user can connect the playlists to another device. 

### _Additional resources needed to complete stretch goals:_

This project will require a lot of research in the Spotify dev tools, and stretch goals will require me to explore some of their newer features such as the Spotify SDK player and the Spotify Connect Web API.
